After I finished properly coding all the motors and have them sync with each other, I decided to create a real life prototype in order to provide a better sense of understanding of what it actually does. This is what my project got up to and temporarily looks like this:
<br><br>

<br><br>
The reason why I have four motors was to have two of them be used to create a conveyor belt, two of them to be on the belt, one of the ones on the belt to be used for the cutter, and the other to be used to hold the food as the cutter is cutting. Firstly, when I was thinking of building my prototype, I was obviously thinking of building a base because that's how everything starts. Without a base, catastrophe is bound to happen or other process of the prototype won't be able to be built. So this is what I came up with:

<h6>Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures while I was building it, however, lets use this model as if I was designing it. Also it's not drawn to scale.</h6>

I planned to use this base structure in order to hold up the conveyor belt and have openings to have a place for the axles. Speaking of axles, I would design the axles next and this is what I had in plan for the front and back axle:

The back axle consist of four nuts so that it can hold the bearing and there's two bearing to hold the belt. The front axle was similar to the back axle, but instead of nuts, it was super glued and instead of bearing it was bottle caps because I need something with rigid edges to move the items on the conveyor belt. If it was too smooth, the belt wouldn't be guided and it would act if it was a bearing. One side is also open ended so the motor can stick it's shaft could stick in the axle and guide it. After using brackets and nails to stablize almost everything, here's how it looks like in person:

<br><br>
In the end, I have a successful visual prototype that worked as intended, but I had to guide the motors myself a bit because they were too weak. I also had to use a ball to hold the servo motor up because the belt itself was kind of curved inwards and I tape both the ball and motor down on the conveyor belt for more stability. I had to also cut the number of motors because they weren't needed for the prototype to work and could perfectly work fine with two. They were also chomping up electricity from the other motors. Here's a visual of it making a cut:

Currently I'm in the mix of the sixth and seventh step of my engineering design process (EDP) where I improved my last prototype only from [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4s5I2YapnTg-dazzling-luulia-inari?sharecode=kAdRuS3yJFK39LdAcJQ4zbFGMXdLbcXQBJVlo_xg68g), into a visual prototype and I tested it to show what my project was actually about. I would move on to the eigth step of my EDP where I present my project in the upcoming expository. The two skills I used were problem decomposition and attention to detail. I used problem decomposition to break down what I need to prioritize first in order to move onto the next step. I also used attention to detail in order to find specific components I need to build the prototype. Whether it was the size of the component or the type of the component, it all really matters because one small lose area could've broke it or made it not work.
