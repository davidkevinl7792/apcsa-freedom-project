# Entry 1
##### 11/12/23

  I was deciding between using [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to create a website that stores receipes and sends information to a hardware to prepare ingredients or [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) to create the hardware itself. In the end, I decided to go with arduino to get some hands on activity and coding on the computer at the same time. I started by searching up where the software is to code for the hardware; which they had their own [ide](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) for me to use. I started by trying to create something simple which was making a led blub blink. I followed the [SIK guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v33/experiment-1-blinking-an-led) and was able to get it blinking. I tried to see if I switch some placements on the breadboard like change the wires position to connect to the negative side of the led and see if it works. Turns out positioning does matter since it stopped blinking right after I put the wire in the wrong place. I would try to create a turning motor next and see if I could attach a blade on it to slice stuff.

  Currently I'm on the first step of my engineering design process (EDP) which was to define the problem and figure out what tool I wanted to use. I would be moving on to my second step of my EDP to research the problem and research more into my tool. The two skills I used was embracing failure and how to read. I had to learn how to read the physical copy of the SIK guide and I learn how to embracing failure when I learned that positioning matters and I can't place things randomly.
