# APCSA Freedom Project
by **David Liu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study Arduino in order to help me make food chopper.

## Implications
##### PROS
* eco-friendly; only requires electricity with no emission
* anybody can use it for preparing ingredients
* not enough to take over jobs as it's only a helping hand
##### CONS
* can only chop one thing at a time and has to be reconfigured every time you cut something new
* a bit costly ($50+)
* laziness occurance if you solely rely on the machine
